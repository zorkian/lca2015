Hello LCA 2015 tutorial-goer!

First, if you use Windows, I'm sorry; this should work, but you'll have to
modify the directions for your setup. I haven't tested on Windows.

To prepare for this tutorial, please:

  1. Open up your favorite shell (bash/zsh/fish)

  2. cd to the directory you copied from the USB stick (gostick/)

  3. ls packages/ and pick the one that is best for you, they should be named
     in a relatively straightforward fashion.

  4. Untar the selected package into the gostick/ dir, like:

        username:~/gostick$ tar -zxvf packages/go1.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

     Now, if you "ls -l", you should see something like this:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 marksmith  staff  120 Jan  3 22:52 bash.sh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 marksmith  staff  118 Jan  3 22:52 fish.sh
drwxr-xr-x  20 marksmith  staff  680 Jan  3 22:50 go
drwxr-xr-x   3 marksmith  staff  102 Jan  3 22:51 helloworld
drwxr-xr-x  12 marksmith  staff  408 Jan  3 22:46 packages
...

     It's important that you untar the tarball from packages/ so that it ends
     up in the go/ directory.

  5. Source the right file for your shell ("source bash.sh" etc)

  6. Verify go works, type "go", and you should see:

        username:~/gostick$ go
Go is a tool for managing Go source code.
...

  7. If the worst happens, ask a neighbor and/or ask for help so that you
     are with us as we move along. :-)
